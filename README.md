# AletheiaProof
**WIP:** AletheiaProof is a proof verifier, with a focus on everyday mathematics rather than higher-order logic or type theory. Proofs can be crafted using a Node Editor or as text in the informal yet structured style familiar to mathematicians, which is automatically converted into a formal proof graph based on set theory with customizable axioms, such as ZFC. Using AletheiaProof as basis, **AletheiaAutoProof**, a deep learning-powered proof generator, trains on tokenized proof graphs or directly on graph representations, leveraging algorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformer-based architectures for sequence-to-graph and graph-to-sequence translation, and reinforcement learning to optimize proof generation strategies. By decoding the generated proofs back into the Aletheia framework, the resulting outputs hopefully closely resemble the conventional style of mathematical proof writing.
