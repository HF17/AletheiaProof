# AletheiaProof
**WIP:** AletheiaProof is a proof verifier, with a focus on everyday mathematics rather than higher-order logic or type theory. Proofs can be crafted using a Node Editor or in the informal yet structured style familiar to mathematicians, which is automatically converted into a formal proof graph based on set theory with customizable axioms, such as ZFC. The project also features **AletheiaAutoProof**, a deep learning-powered proof generator that trains on tokenized proof graphs or directly on graph representations, leveraging algorithms such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformer-based architectures for sequence-to-graph and graph-to-sequence translation, and reinforcement learning to optimize proof generation strategies
